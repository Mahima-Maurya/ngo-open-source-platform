# Authentication Setup Guide - Lavanya Foundation Website

## Current Status
✅ **Website is deployment-ready**  
✅ **Firebase Database connected and working**  
⚠️ **Firebase Authentication setup pending**  
✅ **Fallback authentication system active**

## Authentication Options

### Option 1: Quick Access (Immediate)
**For immediate access to admin panel:**
- Go to `admin.html`
- Use credentials: `admin` / `admin123`
- This works with or without Firebase

### Option 2: Firebase Authentication Setup (Recommended)
**For production security with Firebase:**

1. **Test Firebase Connection:**
   - Open `firebase-test.html` in your browser
   - Check if all Firebase services are connected
   - If issues found, follow the troubleshooting steps shown

2. **Create Firebase Admin User:**
   - If Firebase test passes, open `setup-auth.html`
   - Create an admin user with email and password
   - This enables full Firebase authentication

3. **Alternative Firebase Setup:**
   - If connection issues persist, open `simple-setup.html`
   - This provides a simpler authentication setup

### Option 3: Custom Password Setup
**To change the default password:**
- Open `simple-setup.html`
- Set a custom admin password
- This updates the fallback authentication system
